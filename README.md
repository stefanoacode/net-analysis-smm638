## Module overview

Networks are ubiquitous: job offerings reach us via inter-personal
connections; what we see on the screen of our digital device is a
function of the relationships we develop in the digital world; market
valuations are ― largely ― the byproduct of social influence, which
accumulates and spreads over relations. This module provides students
with cutting-edge network theories and practical tools to appreciate the
organization and functioning of disparate networks. Ultimately, the goal
is to develop a distinctive angle on how networks bring value to
individuals, organizations, and communities.

## Materials & readings

SMM638 sticks with a GitHub-based workflow. The only way to get access to 
the latest version of lecture notes, code, and data is to use this GitHub
repo.

For this module, you aren't required to purchase any book, whereas it is key 
you carefully consider the following set of __mandatory materials__:

- lecture notes (to be uploaded onto
  Moodle/[Github](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638)
  weekly; they include slideshows + videos);
- weekly [lecture notes](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/blob/fab7aa6bd71b57efcc42fed5f5e6cfac961ce8dd/lectureNotes)

## Learning objectives

At the end of the module, students should be able to:

- appreciate the properties of networks;
- appreciate the properties of communities of nodes belonging to a
  network;
- appreciate the properties of individual nodes belonging to a
  network;
- visually represent the key features of networks;
- leverage the most advanced Python modules for network analytics;
- mobilize key network analytics notions and tools in order to
  produce elegant, effective, and efficient solutions to practical
  problems in the field of business strategy, product innovation, and
  operations.

## Assessment

As per the module specification, students will be assessed on the basis of
coursework submissions (yes, you understand correctly, for this module there is
no final examination). Specifically, there are two pieces of coursework, namely:

- a __group-level__ 'mid-term project' (MTP)
- an __individual-level__ 'final course project' (FCP)

__Both pieces of coursework__ will be evaluated against four criteria: i)
appropriate use of notions and frameworks discussed in class; ii)
effectiveness of the proposed answer or solution; iii)
originality/creativity of the proposed answer or solution; iv)
organization and clarity of submitted materials. All criteria carry out the
equal weight in terms of marking.

Here's the calculation of the Final Mark (FM):

$FM = \frac{MTP + FCP}{2}$

### Mid-term project

For the MTP, students will work in __groups__ to solve a complex visualization
problem. The details of the MTP will be available on October 19, when the
project will be released. Submissions will be assessed on a 0 - 100% scale. The
Groups who fail MTP can resubmit a revised version of the project; if the
revision is sufficient, students receive a 50% mark. The deadline for the
project is November 15. Few groups (e.g., three groups) will be invited to
present the outcome of their work to fellow students in week 6.  Invited groups
could also receive a maximum of three (3) bonus points on the basis of the quality of
their presentations.

To clarify your expectations about the MTP, please consider the [assignments
administered to the previous BA cohorts](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/tree/master/pastAssigments).

### Final course project

With the FCP, students will work __individually__ to help a real-world client to
face some data challenges that can best be addressed using a network analytics
angle. Details about the client and the challenge will be available on November
16. Final course projects will be evaluated on a rolling basis and should be
submitted by December 17.

To clarify your expectations about the FCP, please consider the [assignments
administered to the previous BA cohorts](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/tree/master/pastAssigments).

## Case studies

Case studies provide students with the opportunity to learn how to integrate
the 'business' and the 'network analytics' perspectives in order to deal
effectively with real-world problems. In terms of process, groups of students
will receive i) a detailed description of a business issue, and ii) relevant
data. Then, they will be working for one week to produce their own solution.
The views on the case will be discussed in class during an interactive session
led by the lecturer. Students could be cold-called during the session and asked
to share their solutions.

## Discretionary coursework

__Problem sets (PS)__ will be launched weekly. Individual students may want to
deal with these problem sets and present their solutions to the class. A maximum
of three students per session will be selected on the basis of the novelty and
effectiveness of the proposed solution. One bonus point (+1 FM) will be
assigned.

To clarify your expectations about PSs, please consider the [assignments
administered to the previous BA cohorts](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/tree/master/pastAssigments).

## Guest speakers

Subject to the Covid-19-related norms and actions, SMM638 might host short talks
from two types of guest speakers: ambassadors — former students of the BA 
program — and practitioners.
## Prerequisites

- The SMM692 ― Python Pre-Course module defines the knowledge students should
possess in order to proficiently attend SMM635 ― Data Visualization.  
- Basic knowledge of the Git versioning software as implemented in GitHub (see the
official [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com))


## Software Requirements

For this module, you're supposed to run Python 3.7 or higher on your machine. Now,
how to get Python to work on your machine? There are several ways to do
that. A fast, smooth alternative is to install
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/), an open-source
distribution of Python that includes: i) 250+ popular data science
packages; ii) the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) package,
which makes it quick and easy to install, run, and upgrade complex data
science and machine learning environments.

Here is the workflow:

1.  Use your preferred browser to open the link pointing to the
    [Anaconda repository](http://www.numpy.org/);
2.  Select the installer the which suits your machine (32- or 64-bit)
    and operating system (Win, Mac OS, Linux). Mac users may want to
    download the graphical installer rather than the command-line
    installer (students may feel less comfortable with it);
3.  Retrieve the installer (perhaps in your download folder);
4.  Run the installer;
5.  Log-out from your current session (it does not matter if you use
    Win, Mac OS or Linux);
6.  Log-in into a new session;
7.  Run 'Anaconda Navigator' — namely, a convenient place to launch the
    IPython shell or other user-interfaces to interact with IPython.

On top of Anaconda ― Python, students should install the modules:

- [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/)
- [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
- [Graph-Tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/). Note Graph-Tool is a 'complex' 
  library (i.e., it depends on several Pyhon and C++ libraries); you may want 
  to follow the installation instructions reported under 
  the [`resources`](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/tree/master/resources/graphTool) 
  section of this repo.
