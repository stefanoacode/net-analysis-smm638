# Python environments â€“ README

Two distinct environments should be created:

+   a general purpose environment
+   another for efficient network analysis

The text file `general_purpose.txt` included in this folder contains the core libraries that should populate the three environments. Whilst not necessary, additional libraries could complement the core ones.

The environment for efficient network analysis is based on Graph-Tool. Please check the [Resources](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/tree/master/resources) folder for a installation instructions.
