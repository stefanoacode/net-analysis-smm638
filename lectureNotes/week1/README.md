# Week 1 ― README

In the first week, I'm going to:

1. present the organization and functioning of SMM638
2. make sure everybody gets a Python environment for network analytics work
3. present some desktop-oriented IDEs for Python
4. highlight some key points from the lecture notes ― see [slideshow_1.ipynb](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/blob/fab7aa6bd71b57efcc42fed5f5e6cfac961ce8dd/lectureNotes/week1/slideshow_1.ipynb)

Make sure you go through the video recording [smm638_1](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/646ca999-91a3-48ea-b43b-d574437d4f51)
before the live session.
