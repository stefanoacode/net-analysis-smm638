# Week 5 Materials

In the fifth week of the module, we're going to focus on:

- scale-free networks
- the process that generates scale-free networks, namely preferential attachment
- how to use the NetworkX and the PowerLaw libraries to test whether 
  concrete networks conform with the scale-free form 
  
Here are the relevant materials:

- Video-recording:
  - [smm638_6, scale-free networks][video]
- Lecture notes:
  - [slideshow_1.ipynb][slides]
- Further materials:
  - under the folder `tutorials`, there are a series of Python scripts
    that shows how to get the degree distribution of a network. These
    scripts are key to appreciate the signature of preferential 
    attachment networks
