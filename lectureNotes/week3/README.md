# Week 4 — README

In the third week of the module, we're going to:

- familiarize with the idea of network modularity
- appreciate concrete forms of network modularity, such as small-world and core-periphery structures
- discover communities in networks
- use NetworkX and [CPnet](https://github.com/skojaku/core-periphery-detection) to assess different types of network modularity in the data

Please consider the following set of materials:

- Video-recording:
  -  [smm638_4, small worlds, core-periphery, and community structures](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/b430be07-66c9-4e99-94c9-dc5c37144278)
- Lecture notes:
  - [slideshow_1.ipynb](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/blob/master/lectureNotes/week3/slideshow_1.ipynb)
- Further materials concerning 'labs' and the problem set might be made available during the Tue 19 lecture
